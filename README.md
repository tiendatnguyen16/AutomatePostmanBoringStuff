This is a README file.

**1. Create variables for the currently selected environment, the values will be collection's Uid (which are needed for submitting Postman challenges)**  
*createEnvironmentVariables.js*

**IMPORTANT**
*This script must be run using Postman pre-request or post-response script, it means we need to create pre-request or post-response script, then run the request in Postman, not using VS Studio Code.*

**2. Automatically fork all collections or selected collections from a public workspace**  
*forkCollection.js*

**3. Markdown is cool**  
Use "*" to surround the text that you want to make it *Italic*  
Use "**" to surround the text that you want to make it **Bold**.

**4. Delete duplicated collections for a workspace**

deleteDuplicatedCollections.js


2 enter keys after the "cool" will move this line here.
One enter key hit will not move the wanted line down.  
*two spaces and an Enter key hit will bring this down, and it looks much nicer*

*Hit Enter 2 times is for making the text not full of text, easier to read*
