This is a README file.

**1. Create variables for the currently selected environment, the values will be collection's Uid (which are needed for submitting Postman challenges)**  
createEnvironmentVariables.js

**2. Automatically fork all collections or selective collections from a public workspace**  
forkCollection.js

**3. Markdown is cool**

2 enter keys after the "cool" will move this line here.
One enter key hit will not move the wanted line down.  
*two spaces and an Enter key hit will bring this down, and it looks much nicer*

*Hit Enter 2 times is for making the text not full of text, easier to read*
